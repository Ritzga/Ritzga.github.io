                            So I can get interested in things very quickly and then also learn especially fast in this subject.
                            It's like: "(OwO) whats this, that's interesting too and wow that's also interesting".
                            That's why I know so many aground the computer and programming stuff.
                            Scientific topics belong to my interests like physic, chemistry, biology and sub-areas.
                            Computer science (informatics) and electrical engineering is of course, one of them.

                                    I like hiking in the forest (forests at night are the best!), swimming in a swimming pool
                                    and playing floorball. Furthermore, I like reading books and science magazines.
                                    The topics of the books are usually zombie/post-apocalyptic (<a href="http://jlbourne.com/" target="_blank">Day by day armageddon</a>
                                    is my favorite book), science fiction novels, science fiction thriller. So yeah,
                                    I've read many books.

                                    I have a big ideas folder where many ideas are implemented not yet (like a smarthome system).

                            I love programming and started it with <a href="https://www.autoitscript.com/site/" target="_blank">AutoIt3</a>.
                            This is a easy and powerful scripting language with a nice windows GUI. After that I learned
                            HTML/css and so I came to php programming. My first homepage works with html4, css and php4.
                            So I developed a lot of unfinished websites and other projects. At a certain point Autoit
                            was not enough anymore and I started to work with C,C++,C# and Java. This led to that C#
                            becoming my favorite language and <a class="jump" href="#content-moreProjects">Put</a> was my first big project.

                            The other part is digital art, animations and other creative stuff. I started with the microsoft
                            program "paint". After that I used <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/" target="_blank">Paint.net</a>
                            and  <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">Gimp</a>. I've created a lot of pictures with
                            Gimp, it's a nice program and a bit easier then Adobe-Photoshop. I like also to create texture maps
                            for 3D models (mostly metal and stone textures). I had a minecraft texture-pack in the past but
                            I was too bad to make objects (like a table and so on) not only textures.

                                    ,a nice program by the way. The advantage is that you can create a game with a full pack

                                    In addition, you can't carry too much stuff with you. There is also a time system with
                                    day-night cycle. The whole scripts are made by me. The game is playable but not finished

                                    It began with a little idea of a game like <a href="https://minecraft.net/de-de/" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>
                                    with strategic game elements. So I designed some sketches of the map and all other
                                    ideas to the game. I decided to make this game with the <a href="https://unity3d.com/de" target="_blank">Unity engine</a>.
                                    (Unity because it's the only engine I know, where you can develop a game with C#).
                                    And I used <a href="https://ephtracy.github.io/" target="_blank">MagicaVoxel</a> to
                                    make some 3D placeholder models.

                                    (take a look on his deviantart page). The another one is a super smart bear, who is

                                    Maybe we can make a playable version of the game. If yes, you will can download it here.

                            Actually this is only a brush but it's a good effect, so I decided to make a wallpaper and yes it has become beautiful.
                            It's sad that the picture is a bit blurred and not 100% sharp, but I can't change it anymore.

                            I also made some smaller hexagons and put it under the big ones to got a little 3D effect.

                                <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;</li>
                                <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</li>

                            <p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.</p>
                            <p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.
