                            I'm a weird person, who do a lot of stuff. Normally this stuff have to do with computers.
                            In addition I'm always sleepy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So I can get interested in things very quickly and then also learn especially fast in this subject.
                            It's like: "(OwO) whats this, that's interesting too and wow that's also interesting".
                            That's why I know so many aground the computer and programming stuff.
                            Scientific topics belong to my interests like physic, chemistry, biology and sub-areas.
                            Computer science (informatics) and electrical engineering is of course, one of them.

                                    I like hiking in the forest (forests at night are the best!), swimming in a swimming pool
                                    and playing floorball. Furthermore, I like reading books and science magazines.
                                    The topics of the books are usually zombie/post-apocalyptic (<a href="http://jlbourne.com/" target="_blank">Day by day armageddon</a>
                                    is my favorite book), science fiction novels, science fiction thriller. So yeah,
                                    I've read many books.

                                    I also draw from time to time (my drawn pictures are not so great). But I draw a lot of
                                    sketches of every possible things (like architecture and game sketches).
                                    I have a big ideas folder where many ideas are implemented not yet (like a smarthome system).
                                    I wish I could develop things only with my mind <i class="far fa-smile"></i>.

                        <p>
                            I love programming and started it with <a href="https://www.autoitscript.com/site/" target="_blank">AutoIt3</a>.
                            This is a easy and powerful scripting language with a nice windows GUI. After that I learned
                            HTML/css and so I came to php programming. My first homepage works with html4, css and php4.
                            So I developed a lot of unfinished websites and other projects. At a certain point Autoit
                            was not enough anymore and I started to work with C,C++,C# and Java. This led to that C#
                            becoming my favorite language and <a class="jump" href="#content-moreProjects">Put</a> was my first big project.

                            The other part is digital art, animations and other creative stuff. I started with the microsoft
                            program "paint". After that I used <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/" target="_blank">Paint.net</a>
                            and  <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">Gimp</a>. I've created a lot of pictures with
                            Gimp, it's a nice program and a bit easier then Adobe-Photoshop. I like also to create texture maps
                            for 3D models (mostly metal and stone textures). I had a minecraft texture-pack in the past but
                            I was too bad to make objects (like a table and so on) not only textures.

                                    It's a 2D RPG with survival style. The story is that the main character is shipwrecked
                                    and saved her/himself on an unknown island. The main quest is to build a ocean-going
                                    ship. There are 3 other islands near by the main island. So she/he can build small boats
                                    to discover these islands. But be careful, there are some unexpected enemies...

                                    ,a nice program by the way. The advantage is that you can create a game with a full pack
                                    of game-resources.
                                </p>

                                    The main island is nearby finished and the survival system is active too. So you have
                                    to eat to satisfy hunger, to drink to stay hydrated and sleep to stay healthy.
                                    In addition, you can't carry too much stuff with you. There is also a time system with

                                    yet, so I didn't released it (maybe in a year or two) absolutely after I finished

                                    It began with a little idea of a game like <a href="https://minecraft.net/de-de/" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>
                                    with strategic game elements. So I designed some sketches of the map and all other
                                    ideas to the game. I decided to make this game with the <a href="https://unity3d.com/de" target="_blank">Unity engine</a>.
                                    (Unity because it's the only engine I know, where you can develop a game with C#).
                                    And I used <a href="https://ephtracy.github.io/" target="_blank">MagicaVoxel</a> to
                                    make some 3D placeholder models.

                                    Now I have a Team of 3 students to work on the game in our free time. One of us is a
                                    great 3D digital artist His name is <a href="https://tohmis.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">Thomis</a>
                                    (take a look on his deviantart page). The another one is a super smart bear, who is
                                    a awesome programmer and software developer. His name is <a href="https://github.com/Sythelux" target="_blank">Sythelux Rikd</a>.
                                    Maybe we can make a playable version of the game. If yes, you will can download it here.

                                    Here do you see the client of the Put. It's really intuitive to use the client.

                                    The Put (project updater tool) is like <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>
                                    a version control system. My Tool is way easier and simpler as git and specified for
                                    projects like games, software or tools, where updated often. So Put is a good way to
                                    have a fast updater for your projects. The whole app is programmed with C# and works
                                    on linux and windows. It's currently under construction and not public.

                                    The current version is 0.1 (so it's a pre alpha version and it works well on windows
                                    or linux (32/64 bit)). It's planned that Put works also on android and ios. The whole
                                    interface will be written in <a href="https://electronjs.org/" target="_blank">Electron</a>.
                                    It's also on the to do list, that Put supports cloud systems (like ondrive, google
                                    drive or owncloud) and Git. So it would be easier for admins.
                                </p>

                                    This is the admin tool of Put and you can see a test project. It's easy to create new
                                    projects the only thing you need is a server with FTP or SFTP and a web access.

                                    It was very nice to make some animations but at a specific point my skills are too bad for
                                    extended animations so I stopped to make 3D animations. So by the way if you want to
                                    watch some animations take a look at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC28A3B3A486E392B" target="_blank">Playlist</a>

                                    My last animation made with the SFM. Here I tested some custom particles (snow particles)
                                    and it was at christmas time.

                                    One of my dreams was to make a super nice intro for my videos on Youtube. So started
                                    to make videos with the "Microsoft movie-maker". After that I used <a href="https://www.techsmith.de/camtasia.html" target="_blank">camtasia studio</a>.
                                    My animations and videos got better but I didn't stop and made the intro (see right)
                                    with <a href="https://www.adobe.com/de/products/aftereffects.html" target="_blank">After Effects CC</a>
                                     (it was the test version, but yes it was enough to make something of it)

                            Actually this is only a brush but it's a good effect, so I decided to make a wallpaper and yes it has become beautiful.
                            It's sad that the picture is a bit blurred and not 100% sharp, but I can't change it anymore.

                            Yep, one of my favorite pictures. Here I inverted the hexagons and got a interesting effect.
                            I also made some smaller hexagons and put it under the big ones to got a little 3D effect.
