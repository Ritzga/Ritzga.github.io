                            So I can get interested in things very quickly and then also learn especially fast in this subject.
                            It's like: "(OwO) whats this, that's interesting too and wow that's also interesting".
                            That's why I know so many aground the computer and programming stuff.
                            Scientific topics belong to my interests like physic, chemistry, biology and sub-areas.
                            Computer science (informatics) and electrical engineering is of course, one of them.

                                    I like hiking in the forest (forests at night are the best!), swimming in a swimming pool
                                    and playing floorball. Furthermore, I like reading books and science magazines.
                                    The topics of the books are usually zombie/post-apocalyptic (<a href="http://jlbourne.com/" target="_blank">Day by day armageddon</a>
                                    is my favorite book), science fiction novels, science fiction thriller. So yeah,
                                    I've read many books.

                                    I also draw from time to time (my drawn pictures are not so great). But I draw a lot of

                                    I have a big ideas folder where many ideas are implemented not yet (like a smarthome system).

                            I love programming and started it with <a href="https://www.autoitscript.com/site/" target="_blank">AutoIt3</a>.
                            This is a easy and powerful scripting language with a nice windows GUI. After that I learned
                            HTML/css and so I came to php programming. My first homepage works with html4, css and php4.
                            So I developed a lot of unfinished websites and other projects. At a certain point Autoit
                            was not enough anymore and I started to work with C,C++,C# and Java. This led to that C#
                            becoming my favorite language and <a class="jump" href="#content-moreProjects">Put</a> was my first big project.

                            The other part is digital art, animations and other creative stuff. I started with the microsoft
                            program "paint". After that I used <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/" target="_blank">Paint.net</a>
                            and  <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">Gimp</a>. I've created a lot of pictures with
                            Gimp, it's a nice program and a bit easier then Adobe-Photoshop. I like also to create texture maps
                            for 3D models (mostly metal and stone textures). I had a minecraft texture-pack in the past but
                            I was too bad to make objects (like a table and so on) not only textures.

                                    ,a nice program by the way. The advantage is that you can create a game with a full pack
                                    of game-resources.

                                    to eat to satisfy hunger, to drink to stay hydrated and sleep to stay healthy.
                                    In addition, you can't carry too much stuff with you. There is also a time system with
                                    day-night cycle. The whole scripts are made by me. The game is playable but not finished
                                    yet, so I didn't released it (maybe in a year or two) absolutely after I finished

                                    It began with a little idea of a game like <a href="https://minecraft.net/de-de/" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>
                                    with strategic game elements. So I designed some sketches of the map and all other
                                    ideas to the game. I decided to make this game with the <a href="https://unity3d.com/de" target="_blank">Unity engine</a>.
                                    (Unity because it's the only engine I know, where you can develop a game with C#).
                                    And I used <a href="https://ephtracy.github.io/" target="_blank">MagicaVoxel</a> to
                                    make some 3D placeholder models.

                                    Now I have a Team of 3 students to work on the game in our free time. One of us is a

                                    (take a look on his deviantart page). The another one is a super smart bear, who is

                                    Maybe we can make a playable version of the game. If yes, you will can download it here.

                            Actually this is only a brush but it's a good effect, so I decided to make a wallpaper and yes it has become beautiful.

                            I also made some smaller hexagons and put it under the big ones to got a little 3D effect.
